\section{Chapter 1: The Compiler \& Hello World}
C was created in 1970 by Dennis Ritchie during his time at Bell Labs as the implementation language of Unix. With it's success being put down to the popularity of Unix and in part as it's adoption of a standard programming language \cite{cHist}. To create a C program, one needs a compiler to change the code into machine code. There are many choices available such as MinGW, CLang and the original pcc (Portable C Compiler). However, this text will work purely with the GCC compiler as it has it's roots in the free C compiler of 1984 and is what Linux, *BSD and Apple's Xcode (until recently) uses to compile C - it is fair to say that GCC is one of the most used compilers today and throughout history.\\
\subsection{GCC on a system}
GCC is essentially a set of command line tool that can be installed on any common computer system. One will need to install GCC (binaries can be found here: \url{https://gcc.gnu.org/}) to follow on with this text.\\
Once GCC is installed on your host we can go through the basics.\\
