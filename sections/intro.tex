\section{Introduction}
This tutorial will be written over the course of weeks \& months fro my friend David. The initial idea for this came from him needing help with C and I thought I could help him out be creating some tutorials and explanations... So why not make this public if I'm going to put the effort into it?\\
This is not meant to replace any of the much better written tutorials out there or to be used as a definitive guide. It is more for a tool to traverse the great space of C and a project for me to do as I complete my 8 month internship in VHDL programming. Who knows, I might end up writing one of these tutorials in VHDL for David as well.\\
\\I run a Linux system on my main computer, which is a Unix like system (so is MacOs). This means that I use \texttt{./} to execute a program, whereas on Windows, you can just enter the program name into the command prompt to run it. Other than this there should be very little differences between any machine.
\\To go over some basics of this document, command line stuff is entered within a command line box with \texttt{\$} denoting the prompt. Further, any file is represented within a file box with it's example name at the top of the box.
