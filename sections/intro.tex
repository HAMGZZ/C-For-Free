\section{Introduction}
This tutorial will be written over the course of weeks \& months fro my friend David. The initial idea for this came from him needing help with C and I thought I could help him out be creating some tutorials and explanations... So why not make this public if I'm going to put the effort into it?\\
This is not meant to replace any of the much better written tutorials out there or to be used as a definitive guide. It is more for a tool to traverse the great space of C and a project for me to do as I complete my 8 month internship in VHDL programming. Who knows, I might end up writing one of these tutorials in VHDL for David as well.\\
